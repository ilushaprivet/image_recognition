tudy of the training procedure and functioning of the Hopfield recurrent neural network as an auto-associative memory device. The original images in the form of numbers 3 4 5 are encoded in the form of bipolar matrices-patterns of dimension 3x5, the matrices are vectorized and the weights of the Hopfield recurrent neural network are adjusted according to the rule of associative learning (Hebb). The activation function is specified and the algorithm for functioning of the Hopfield neural network in asynchronous mode is implemented. The neural network was tested on stored reference images and tested on distorted patterns with changes of about 10% of pixels.
